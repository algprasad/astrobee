Here we describe how to build a map.

# Summary {#buildmap}

1. Reduce the number of images.

2. Set up the environment.

3. Build the map.

4. Find control points in hugin, and create a list of their coordinates.

5. Register the map.

# Map Building

We go through how a map is made.

## Reduce the number of images.

Here, we delete the images that overlap highly.

  select_images -density_factor 1 bag_images/*.jpg

This is a non-reversible operation, so it should be invoked on a copy
of the images.

The higher the value of the density factor, the more images will be
kept. Some experimentation with this number is necessary (the default
likely removes too many images). Ideally the images should have
perhaps on the order of 2/3 to 3/4 of overlap.

Alternatively, one can simply first pick every 10th or 20th image,
such as:

  ls bag_images/*0.jpg

then copy these to a new directory, open them with an image viewer
like eog, and delete redundant ones in this viewer.

## Setup the Environment

In the first step, one needs to set some environmental variables, as
follows:

export ASTROBEE_RESOURCE_DIR=/path/to/freeflyer/astrobee/resources
export ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/freeflyer/astrobee/config
export ASTROBEE_ROBOT=p4d
export ASTROBEE_WORLD=granite

Here, p4d is the robot being used to take pictures, and the world is
the granite table. These may need to change, depending on your
goals. Under the hood, the following configuration files will be read:

  $ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR/cameras.config

which contains the image width and height (the camera we use is
the nav cam) and

  $ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR/robots/$ASTROBEE_ROBOT.config

having nav cam's intrinsics. If your camera is not the nav cam on p4d,
and none of the other available config files apply, you can just
temporarily modify the above files to reflect your camera's parameters
(without checking in your changes).

More details on these and other environmental variables can be found in

  freeflyer/astrobee/readme.md

## Building a Map

Execute this command to construct a complete map:

  build_map <image files> [ -num_subsequent_images <val> ] -output_map <output.map>

During map building, every image will be matched against every
subsequent image in the sequence. To use only a limited number of
subsequent images, set the value passed to the
`-num_subsequent_images` flag. Later, we will also see how to match
only similar images using a vocabulary tree.

The runtime of the algorithm is directly proportional to the number of
input images times the number input to
`-num_subsequent_images`. Making the latter small will result in more
drift. If you know that a region will be revisited after say 100
images, use this number for this parameter. Making this too big will
result in very slow map building.

### Map Building Pipeline

The `build_map` command runs a number of steps, which can also be invoked
individually for further control.

1. **Detect Interest Points**

    build_map <image files> -feature_detection [ -sample_rate <N> ]
                            [ -detector <detector> ] [ -descriptor <descriptor> ]

Detects features in all of the input images and save them to a map
file. The `-sample_rate <N>` flag, if specified, builds the map from
only one out of N input images. If desired, the feature detector and
feature descriptor can be specified. The default is ORGBRISK.

2. **Match Images**

    build_map -feature_matching [ -num_subsequent_images <val> ]

Match the detected features between images, detecting similar features
that appear in multiple images. The number of subsequent images to
match against can be specified, otherwise all pairwise matches are
evaluated.

3. **Build Tracks**

    build_map -track_building

Take the feature matchings and form "tracks" of features seen
consistently across multiple frames.

4. **Incremental Bundle Adjustment**

    build_map -tensor_initialization

  Incremental bundle adjustment for transform initialization.

5. **Bundle Adjustment**

    build_map -bundle_adjustment

  Adjust the initial transformations to minimize error with bundle adjustment.

6. **Map Rebuilding**

    build_map -rebuild

Rebuilds the map with a different feature set (by default, BRISK
features). The initial map can be built with high quality features,
such as SURF, and then rebuilt with faster features for localization,
such as BRISK. During rebuilding the cameras are kept fixed by
default, since BRISK features, while faster, may be fewer and less
accurate.

Rebuilding is much faster than building from scratch, since it borrows
from the original map the information about which images can be
matched to which, and also reuses the camera positions.

To replace the camera intrinsics during rebuilding, one can use
-rebuild_replace_camera, when the camera is set via ASTROBEE_ROBOT.
Camera positions and orientations can be re-optimized with
-rebuild_refloat_cameras. To rebuild with a desired feature detector,
use the option -rebuild_detector.

7. **Vocabulary Database**

    build_map -vocab_db

Builds a vocabulary database for fast lookup of matching image pairs.
Without this, we have to compare to every image in the map for
localization.  The vocabulary database makes the runtime logarithmic
instead of linear.

The above options can also be chained. For example, to
run the pipeline without tensor initialization, you could do:

    build_map <image files> -feature_detection -feature_matching -track_building -bundle_adjustment

### Additional Options

There are a few steps that can be used which are not included in the default map
building process. These include:

* `-tensor_initialization`: Initialize transformation matrices between nearby images.
* `-loop_closure`: Take a map where images start repeating, and close the loop.
* `-covariance_computation`: Compute the covariance of the triangulated points
   (after bundle adjustment only).
* `-registration`: Register to a real-world coordinate system, discussed later.
* `-verification`: Verify how an already registered map performs on an independently 
   acquired set of control points and corresponding 3D measurements.
* `-info`: Print some information about the map, including list of images.
* `-assume_nonsequential`: If true, assume during incremental SfM that an 
   image need not be similar to the one before it. Slows down the process a lot.
`
The `build_map` command uses the file `output.map` as both input and output
unless the flag `-output_map` is specified.

## Map Registration

Maps are built in arbitrary coordinate systems. They need to be
aligned into a real-world coordinate system using manually defined
control points.

To transform a map to real-world coordinates using control points,
first open a subset of the images used to build the map in Hugin.  Go
to the "Expert" interface, then select matching control points across
a pair of images (make sure the left and right image are not the
same). Then repeat this process for several more pairs.

Save the Hugin project to disk. Create a separate text file which
contains the world coordinates of the control points picked earlier,
with each line in the "x y z" format, and in the same order as the
Hugin project file.  That is to say, if a control point was picked in
several image pairs in Hugin, it must show up also several times in
the text file. In the xyz text file all lines starting with the pound
sign (#) are ignored, as well as all entries on any line beyond three
numerical values.

The locations of the control points can be found in 
`localization/marker_tracking/ros/launch/granite_lab_tags.xml`

Then register the map with the command:

    build_map -registration <hugin files> <xyz files> -num_ba_passes 1 \
      -skip_filtering -output_map <mapfile.map>

There can be multiple such files passed as input. Control point files
are expected to end in .pto, while xyz files in .txt.

At the end of this, bundle adjustment is redone using the control
points and xyz measurements as additional information. The xyz
measurements are kept fixed during this optimization (unlike the xyz
points obtained purely through interest point matching and
triangulation) because the measurements are known fixed quantities.

A good sanity check for the quality of xyz points is to register
without doing bundle adjustment, hence to invoke registration with
-registration_skip_bundle_adjustment. This will show how close the
measured xyz points are to their computed and registered counterparts.

## Map Verification

A registered and bundle-adjusted map can be used to study how well it
predicts the computed 3D locations for an independently acquired set
of control points and 3D measurements. These are in the same format as
for registration. The map is not modified in any way during this step.

    build_map -verification <hugin files> <xyz files>
