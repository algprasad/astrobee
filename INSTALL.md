# Usage instructions for non-NASA users

Install the 64-bit version of [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04)
on a host machine, and make sure that you can checkout and build code.
If you are using a virtual machine, please use VMware. Virtualbox doesn't
support some of our Gazebo plugins.

    sudo apt-get install build-essential git

*Note: You will need 4 GBs of RAM to compile the software. If you don't have
that much RAM available, please use swap space.*

*Note: Please ensure you install Ubuntu 16.04. At this time we do not support
any other operating system or Ubuntu version.*

*Note: Please ensure you install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. We do not
support running Astrobee Robot Software on 32-bit systems.*

## Machine setup

### Checkout the project source code

At this point you need to decide where you'd like to put the source code
(`SOURCE_PATH`) on your machine:
```
    export SOURCE_PATH=$HOME/freeflyer
```
First, clone the flight software repository:
```
    git clone https://github.com/nasa/astrobee.git $SOURCE_PATH
```

If you are planning to work on guest science stuff, you will also need the
`astrobee_android` repository. You should checkout the repository in the same
directory you checked out the source code in:
```
    export ANDROID_PATH="${SOURCE_PATH}_android"
```

Clone the android repository:
```
    git clone https://github.com/nasa/astrobee_android.git $ANDROID_PATH
```

### Dependencies

Next, install all required dependencies:
*Note: `root` access is necessary to install the compiled debian packages below*
*Note: Before running this please ensure that your system is completely updated
    by running 'sudo apt-get update' and then 'sudo apt-get upgrade'*

    pushd $SOURCE_PATH
    cd scripts/setup
    ./add_ros_repository.sh
    sudo apt-get update
    cd debians
    ./build_install_debians.sh
    cd ../
    ./install_desktop_16_04_packages.sh
    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update
    popd

**Important**: you can safely ignore the following error messages, as they are simply letting you know that certain libraries cannot be found. These libraries are for internal NASA use only, and are not required by public users provided that software is launched with DDS disabled.

    E: Unable to locate package libroyale1
    E: Unable to locate package rti
    E: Unable to locate package libmiro0
    E: Unable to locate package libsoracore1
    E: Unable to locate package libroyale-dev
    E: Unable to locate package rti-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libsoracore-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libmiro-dev

### Have System Monitor Ignore DDS ROS Bridge
Since external users do not have access to our internal dds repository, they will not be running or compiling our DDS ROS Bridge. The system monitor needs to be told that the bridge isn't running so that it doesn't assert bridge heartbeat missed faults. In order to do this, please open $SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/robots/sim.config and add "dds_ros_bridge" to the nodes_not_running list the end of the file. If an external user doesn't do this, they will see a "Never received heartbeat from dds_ros_bridge" error which will not cause any issues but can be slightly annoying.

## Configuring the build

### Note for the build setup
By default, the configure script uses the following paths:
  - native build path: `$HOME/freeflyer_build/native`
  - native install path: `$HOME/freeflyer_install/native`

If you are satisfied with these paths, you can invoke the `configure.sh` without
the `-p` and `-b` options. For the simplicity of the instructions below,
we assume that `$BUILD_PATH` and `$INSTALL_PATH` contain the location of the
build and install path. For example:

    export BUILD_PATH=$HOME/freeflyer_build/native
    export INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/freeflyer_install/native

### Native build

The configure script prepares your build directory for compiling the code. Note
that `configure.sh` is simply a wrapper around CMake that provides an easy way
of turning on and off options. To see which options are supported, simply run
`configure.sh -h`.

    pushd $SOURCE_PATH
    ./scripts/configure.sh -l -F -D
    popd

If you want to explicitly specify the build and install directories, use
instead:

    ./scripts/configure.sh -l -F -D -p $INSTALL_PATH -b $BUILD_PATH

*Note: Make sure you use the -F and -D flags. If these flags are not used, the
code will not compile. The -F flag is used to turn off building the Picoflex.
This is only needed for running on the robot and is not needed for the
simulator. The -D is used to turn off building the dds bridge. The bridge is
used to communicate with our ground data system and is also not needed for the
simulator.*

## Building the code

To build, run `make` in the `$BUILD_PATH`. Note that depending on your host
machine, this might take in the order of tens of minutes to complete the first
time round. Future builds will be faster, as only changes to the code are
rebuilt, and not the entire code base.

    pushd $BUILD_PATH
    make -j2
    popd

If you configured your virtual machine with more than the baseline resources,
you can adjust the number of threads (eg. -j4) to speed up the build.

## Running a simulation

You will need to first setup your environment, so that ROS knows about the new
packages provided by Astrobee flight software:

    pushd $BUILD_PATH
    source devel/setup.bash
    popd

After this command has completed, you should be able to run a simulator from any
directory in your Linux filesystem. So, for example, to start a simulation of a
single Astrobee in the ISS, run the following:

    roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true

- Note 1: The very first time Gazebo starts, it could take a long time because
  it loads some large models
- Note 2: To run the simulation with the Gazebo rendering, you can add the flag
  `sviz:=true`. This allow to see the ISS module used for the simulation,
  however this is demanding more resources on your computer.

This command tells ROS to look for the `sim.launch` file provided by the
`astrobee` package, and use roslaunch to run it. Internally, ROS maintains a
cache of information about package locations, libraries and executables. If you
find that the above command doesn't work, try rebuilding the cache:

    rospack profile
